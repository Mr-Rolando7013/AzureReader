SELECT id, displayName, description 
FROM RoleDefinitions 
WHERE permissions LIKE '%Microsoft.Authorization/roleAssignments/write%';

Limitations:
The permissions field in RoleDefinitions is a JSON/text blob, so this string matching works â€” but it's not structured SQL (unless you parse it).

This shows who is assigned a role that allows them to write role assignments, but doesn't show whether they have scope to actually use it (e.g., limited by scope/condition in Azure).

If RoleAssignments table is populated, it could help determine scope. But most access info in roadrecon is at the directory (tenant) level.
